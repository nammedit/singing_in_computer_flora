# singing_in_computer_flora

This is the git-hub repository containing the Supercollider code for my piece for disklavier and performer called "Singing in Computer Flora", composed spring 2020 and funded by The Composers Remuneration Fund (Komponistenes Vederlagsfond) in Norway.

If you're looking to perform the piece, the only file you need to open is the "main(open_this_to_start).scd" file. This file contains comments to help you set everything up.
